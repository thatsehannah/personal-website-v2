# 💼 That's E. Hannah v2

This is the second rendition of my personal website. Project was built using React.js, Gatsby.js, GraphQL, Firebase, and styled-components.

I strived to create a new site to showcase my evolution as a frontend engineer from my previous site. I used more advanced techniques (custom hooks, global state management, system light/dark mode adaptation, setting up backend via Firebase, etc.) and built a fully-functional full stack website. Yes, I could have used Squarespace or Wordpress, but where's the fun in that? I'm an engineer, so of course I had to build my site myself!

This is the first project under my TECH3 umbrella, which is my software development company. Fun fact: "TECH3" stands for "That's Elliot C. Hannah III".
